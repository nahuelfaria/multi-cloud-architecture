# Multi-Cloud Architecture (AWS, GCP, Azure)
1- DNS and Load Balancers:
AWS Route53, Azure DNS, GCP DNS:
- These services manage user requests, directing them to specific load balancers.
- They are the entry points in the architecture, redirecting traffic to load balancer services in each cloud. 

AWS ELB, Azure Load Balancer, GCP Load Balancing:
- Distribute inbound traffic evenly among web servers, ensuring that no instance is overloaded.
- They improve availability and performance by distributing user requests to web servers.

2- Web servers:
AWS EC2, Azure Virtual Machine, GCP GCE:
- These instances run the web applications that users interact with. 
- It provides the computational capacity needed to handle user requests.

GCP GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine):
- Orchestrate containers for applications that require dynamic scalability and advanced management.
- Facilitate the deployment and scalability of containerized applications.

3- Databases
AWS RDS and DynamoDB:
- Store structured and unstructured application data. 
- RDS provides relational databases while DynamoDB provides NoSQL storage.

Azure SQL Database and CosmosDB:
- Store relational and globally distributed data.
- SQL Database handles structured data, while CosmosDB NoSQL with global high availability.

GCP SQL and BigTable: 
- Relational and high-capacity databases.
- GCP SQL handles transactional data while BigTable NoSQL.

4- Storage 
AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCP GCS (Google Cloud Storage):
- They provide scalable and secure storage for unstructured data.
- S3, Blob Storage and GCS are mainly used for storing files, backups and application data.

5- Messaging and Notification Systems
AWS SQS (Simple Queue Service)
- Manages message queues for asynchronous processing, ensuring that tasks are handled efficiently.
- Facilitates the decomposition of large tasks into more manageable parts.

AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service):
- Send notifications to multiple subscribers when specific events occur.
- Keeps systems and users informed of important events.

6- Security and Identity Management:
AWS IAM and KMS, Azure IAM.
- Manage users, roles and permissions to access resources, and handle data encryption.
- Ensure that only authorized users and services can access resources, and protect stored data.

### Workflow
1- DNS: User requests are handled by DNS services that direct traffic to provider-specific load balancers.

2- Load Balancers: Distribute the traffic among the corresponding web servers and this obviously helps to maintain load balancing and improve application availability.

3- Web servers: Handle user requests and communicate with databases for read and write operations. They interact with storage systems to store and retrieve data.

4- Databases: Storage and management of structured and unstructured data.

5- Storage: Facilitates the storage and retrieval of large volumes of unstructured data.

6- Messaging and Notifications: Manage message queues and send notifications to the relevant systems and users.

7- Security: Identity and key management services ensure that only authorized users and services can access resources and that data is protected.
